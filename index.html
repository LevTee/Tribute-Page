        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
          At 6 foot 9, MACROLEV is probably the tallest DJ on Earth and
          certainly one of London’s most exciting.
          <br />
          <br />
          Regularly breaking into Beatport charts and releasing music on labels
          like Hot Fuss, Low Ceiling, Stashed Music and Baikonur Recordings,
          he’s performed at some of the capital’s leading venues, from EGG
          London to Shoreditch Platform and The Box Soho.
          <br />
          <br />
          Most recently, his latest single “Boyfriend” featuring incredible
          singer Oggie and released on Hot Fuss quickly became one of the best
          selling records on Beatport and reached #21 in Hype Chart. His tracks
          like “Charlie’s Trip” and “I Was Doing Drugs” received plays on KISS
          FM UK and huge support from international DJs and tastemakers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Having graduated from the award-winning Point Blank Music School and
          the London Sound Academy’s Elite DJ Course, he is mixing and mastering
          as well as ghost producing for other artists alongside hosting a
          weekly show on Youtube and Mixcloud called MACROSOUNDS, featuring the
          hottest dance music from around the globe.
